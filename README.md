## 📘 Description

This MATLAB App Designer project reads data from a **DHT22 sensor** connected to an **Arduino**, displaying and plotting **temperature (°C)** and **relative humidity (%)** in real time.  

It is released as a **collaborative open project**, encouraging community contributions to add new features, improve performance, and expand compatibility.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Live data acquisition** from the DHT22 sensor.
- **Real-time plots** for temperature and humidity.
- **Numeric indicators** for both parameters.
- **COM port selector** (COM1–COM7) with status lamps.
- **Responsive UI layout** that adapts to window size.
- Fully compatible with **MATLAB Online**.
